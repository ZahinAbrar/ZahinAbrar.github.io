Sensor-based human activity recognition for smart healthcare: A semi-supervised machine learning
------
Published in International conference on artificial intelligence for communications and networks, 2019

Abrar Zahin, Le Thanh Tan, Rose Qingyang Hu

In this paper, we developed a semi-supervised classifier for time series human actions using convolutional variational autoencoder. The proposed classifier can be implemented in various wearable user modules to detect a fall event promptly and notify a caregiver.

A machine learning based framework for the smart healthcare system
------
Published in Intermountain Engineering, Technology and Computing, 2020

Abrar Zahin, Rose Qingyang Hu

In this paper, we developed an energy-efficient framework for detecting \textit{fall actions} from surveillance videos by leveraging the concepts of compressive video sensing and denoising autoencoder. The proposed framework can be adopted in any IoT-based smart healthcare monitoring.
