**Tensor SVD: Statistical and Computational Limits**

Singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis has been an important tool in multivariate and high dimensional data analysis and have been thoroughly studied in the case of matrices, however they only capture first order interactions and ignore higher order ones. In this project we explore the statistical and computational limits for the Tensor SVD problem.

An Information-Theoretic Approach towards Understanding the Utility-privacy Tradeoffs in Databases.
------

In this project, I explored the utility-privacy tradeoff in databases through an information-theoretic lens. The study focused on (theortically) quantifying how privacy-preserving mechanisms impact the utility of shared data, aiming to develop frameworks that balance these conflicting objectives. Key aspects included analyzing privacy constraints, designing mechanisms with provable guarantees, and applying theoretical insights to real-world database scenarios.

Finding optimal policy using Policy Iteration for Electric Vehicle charging demand prediction.
------
Increasing growing of electricity demand and environmental issues bring huge incentives to electric vehicles (EVs) market. EVs will
improve the functionalities of present power system. On the other hand, unscheduled high penetration of EVs may have detrimental effects on
power system performance. This project studies the electric EV charging scheduling problem under a charging station scenario, aiming
to offer an optimal policy to optimize the battery configuration based on load prediction.
