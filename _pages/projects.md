Tensor SVD: Statistical and Computational Limits

Singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis has been an important tool in multivariate and high dimensional data analysis and have been thoroughly studied in the case of matrices, however they only capture first order interactions and ignore higher order ones. In this project we explore the statistical and computational limits for the Tensor SVD problem.

Finding optimal policy using Policy Iteration for Electric Vehicle charging demand prediction.
------
Increasing growing of electricity demand and environmental issues bring huge incentives to electric vehicles (EVs) market. EVs will
improve the functionalities of present power system. On the other hand, unscheduled high penetration of EVs may have detrimental effects on
power system performance. This project studies the electric EV charging scheduling problem under a charging station scenario, aiming
to offer an optimal policy to optimize the battery configuration based on load prediction.
