Finding optimal policy using Policy Iteration for Electric Vehicle charging demand prediction.
------
Increasing growing of electricity demand and environmental issues bring huge incentives to electric vehicles (EVs) market. EVs will
improve the functionalities of present power system. On the other hand, unscheduled high penetration of EVs may have detrimental effects on
power system performance. This project studies the electric EV charging scheduling problem under a charging station scenario, aiming
to offer an optimal policy to optimize the battery configuration based on load prediction.
